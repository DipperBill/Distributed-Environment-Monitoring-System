Distributed environmental monitoring systems have strong demands in various indoor and outdoor applications. At the same time, wireless communication IoT devices are also constantly developing. This paper designs a distributed environmental monitoring system based on STM32, analyzes the background, goals, and proposes schemes from hardware architecture, software algorithms, etc., and puts forward performance indicators. Finally, the possible optimization directions are analyzed..
